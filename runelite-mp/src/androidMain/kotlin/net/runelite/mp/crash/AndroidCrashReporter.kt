/**
 * Thin facade in front of Firebase Crashlytics. Crashlytics auto-installs a default
 * uncaught-exception handler on its first `getInstance()` call (via a ContentProvider
 * declared by its manifest merge), and the SDK handles persistence + retry on next
 * launch on its own. We keep this facade around to:
 *
 *  - Stamp device/app context as Crashlytics custom keys at install time so every
 *    report carries it without per-callsite plumbing.
 *  - Funnel the launcher's own logLine() output into Crashlytics' breadcrumb log so
 *    the report includes the trail of bootstrap/network/plugin events that aren't
 *    visible to Logcat-tailing Crashlytics by default.
 *  - Provide a [forceCrash] smoke-test entry point for verifying the pipeline.
 *
 * Public API is intentionally unchanged from the disk-persisted v0 so callers
 * (RuneLiteLauncher, MainActivity) need no edits when we swap backends again later.
